2. vi Wufoo.cfc and change variables.subdomain and variables.apiKey to your API Key and subdomain.
	- variables.subdomain = stolaf
    - variables.apiKey = 16-character alpha-numeric string (api key is tied to the user, and can be reset on the API information page).
      (a. login to wufoo admin
       b. click on the form tab
	   c. choose any form, and click code

3. build the calling page in the same directory as Wufoo.cfc, (refer to example.com for either javascript or coldfusion usage).

       b. click on the form tab
	   c. choose any form, and click code
	   d. click on API information
